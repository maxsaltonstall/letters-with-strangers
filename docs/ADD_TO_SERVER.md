# Adding to Server

First, go to [the Discord application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)<br/>
Next, click "New Application" in the top right.<br/>
Then you can create a name for your bot. It could be anything you want because the name of the app doesn't affect the name of the bot.<br/>
Next, click on the button on the sidebar that says "Bot" on the left.<br/>
Now you should actually make your app a bot. Click on the button that says "Add Bot" on the top right.<br/>
Next, below "Click to Reveal Token", click "Copy".<br/>
Lastly, create a `.env` file and add the following line:
```
TOKEN=[text you copied]
```
