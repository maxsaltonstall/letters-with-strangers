# Adding to Server

First, go to [the Discord application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
Next, click "New Application" in the top right.
Then you can create a name for your bot. It could be anything you want because the name of the app doesn't affect the name of the bot.
Next, click on the button on the sidebar that says "Bot" on the left.
Now you should actually make your app a bot. Click on the button that says "Add Bot" on the top right.
Next, below "Click to Reveal Token", click "Copy".
Lastly, create a `.env` file and add the following line:
```
TOKEN=[text you copied]
```
